Creatio UI Test Automation Framework
Overview
This project is an automation testing framework designed specifically for Creatio front-end UI.
It allows you to easily create and run automated tests for Creatio pages without spending hours on manual regression checks.

Manual testing is useful for verifying new features, but it is slow and costly for full regression. With automation, you write your tests once and run them repeatedly to instantly detect regressions and check the health of your system.
Creatioâ€™s front-end is not the easiest for automation, so many teams donâ€™t use UI automation at all. This tool solves that problem by providing a ready-to-use solution for automating UI tests in Creatio.
